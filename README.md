# Note-Taker

## Description
This project allowed me to build a note taker application that allows the user to write and save and delete notes. This application uses an express.js back end that will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. This project allowed me to gain a understanding of pathing using Express and linking the HTML page to the back end. I learned about the functionality of the GET, POST, and Delete functions.
